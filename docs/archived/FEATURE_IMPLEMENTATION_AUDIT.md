# Hardmode Feature Implementation Audit

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between what's actually implemented in the codebase versus what documentation suggests might exist.

## Core Architecture

### What's Actually Implemented ✅
- **Simple Node.js/Express server** with Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Client-side JavaScript ES6 modules** with PIXI.js for rendering
- **Shared constants** between client and server (GameConstants.js)

- **30Hz server tick rate** for game state updates

### What Documentation Suggests ❌
- TypeScript everywhere (actually using JavaScript)
- Complex Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
- Sophisticated network architecture with prediction/reconciliation
- Multiple server types (game, lobby, matchmaking)
- Database integration for persistence

## Multiplayer Features

### Working Features ✅

#### Player Management

  - Jump attacks (Guardian, Hunter's retreat shot)
- **Projectile attacks**:
  - Hunter's bow shot (client requests, server creates)
  - Wild Archer monster projectiles
  - Server-authoritative projectile physics
  - Collision detection with monsters/players

- **Visual effects** for attacks (slash effects, projectile sprites)
- **Attack cooldowns** per ability

#### Monster System
- **5 Monster Types**: Ogre, Skeleton, Elemental, Ghoul, Wild Archer
- **Server-controlled AI** with states:
  - Idle (looking for players)
  - Chasing (moving toward target)
  - Attacking (dealing damage)
  - Dying (death animation)
- **Aggro ranges** per monster type
- **Attack patterns**:
  - Melee attacks (Ogre, Skeleton, Ghoul, Elemental)
  - Projectile attacks (Wild Archer)
- **Automatic spawning** (every 5 seconds, max 20 monsters)
- **Smart spawn positioning** (away from players)
- **Death rewards** (XP based on monster type)
- **Attack animations** with proper timing

#### Progression System
- **XP gain** from killing monsters
- **Level system** (1-10)
- **Level up notifications** and effects
- **HP restoration** on level up
- **Kill tracking** per player

#### Visual/UI Features
- **Animated sprites** for all entities
- **8-directional movement** animations
- **Attack animations** per class
- **Death animations**
- **Damage flash effects**
- **Health bars** above entities
- **Stats UI** (HP, Level, XP)
- **Class selection screen**
- **Procedural world generation** (100x100 tiles, seed-based)

### Not Implemented ❌

#### From Documentation/Vision
- **Permadeath** (players respawn after 3 seconds)
- **Item system** (no items/inventory as intended)
- **Crafting** (none, as intended)
- **Advanced combat mechanics**:
  - Skill shots
  - Combo system
  - Parrying/blocking
  - Dodge mechanics beyond roll
- **Player trading**
- **Guilds/parties**
- **Chat system**
- **Leaderboards**
- **Account system/persistence**
- **Multiple game modes**
- **Zones/dungeons**

## Network Protocol

### Implemented Messages ✅

#### Client → Server
- `setClass` - Set player class
- `playerUpdate` - Position and facing updates
- `attack` - Notify server of attack
- `attackMonster` - Damage a specific monster
- `createProjectile` - Request projectile creation

#### Server → Client
- `init` - Initial world state and player ID
- `state` - Full game state update (30Hz)
- `playerJoined` - New player connected
- `playerLeft` - Player disconnected
- `playerAttack` - Player performed attack
- `playerDamaged` - Player took damage
- `playerKilled` - Player died
- `playerRespawned` - Player respawned
- `playerLevelUp` - Player gained a level
- `monsterDamaged` - Monster took damage
- `monsterKilled` - Monster died
- `projectileCreated` - New projectile spawned
- `projectileDestroyed` - Projectile removed

### Not Implemented ❌
- Delta compression
- Binary protocols
- Message queuing/buffering
- Reliable messaging layer
- Lag compensation
- Client prediction/reconciliation
- Server-side movement validation
- Anti-cheat measures

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented ✅
- **View distance culling** for monsters (1500 unit radius)
- **Periodic projectile cleanup**
- **Dead entity removal**
- **Sprite pooling** for animations

### Not Implemented ❌
- Spatial hashing/quadtrees
- Dynamic tick rates
- Network traffic optimization
- Client-side prediction
- Interpolation/extrapolation
- Level of detail (LOD) system

## Debug/Development Features

### Implemented ✅
- **Debug endpoint** (`/debug` for server state inspection)
- **Console logging** for major events
- **Debug logger** system for tracking events

### Not Implemented ❌
- In-game debug UI
- Performance profiling tools
- Network traffic visualization
- Replay system

## Summary

The actual implementation is a **functional, simple multiplayer game** that works well for small-scale play (up to ~10-20 players). It follows a straightforward client-server architecture without the complexity described in some documentation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Working real-time multiplayer
- Smooth combat with multiple attack types
- Functional AI and progression
- Clean, understandable codebase

**Key Limitations:**
- No persistence between sessions
- Basic networking (works but not optimized)
- Limited to small player counts
- No anti-cheat or validation

The game achieves its core vision of "skill-based combat where level 1 can beat level 10" through the combat mechanics, even without the more complex features described in documentation.
