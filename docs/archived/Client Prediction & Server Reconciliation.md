# Client Prediction & Server Reconciliation

## Overview
Implement industry-standard client prediction with server reconciliation to achieve smooth, responsive movement while maintaining server authority. This is how games like Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and Valorant handle movement.

## Core Concept
1. **Client predicts** movement immediately for instant responsiveness
2. **Server validates** and sends authoritative state
3. **Client reconciles** differences and replays inputs if needed
4. **Result**: Smooth local movement with server authority

## Architecture Changes Needed

### Input System Redesign
- **Buffer all inputs** with timestamps and sequence numbers
- Send inputs to server instead of sending positions
- Keep input history for reconciliation

### Client Prediction Engine
- **Predict movement** locally using same physics as server
- Apply inputs immediately to local player
- Store predicted states with sequence numbers

### Server Input Processing
- **Process inputs** in order with server physics
- Send back authoritative position + last processed input sequence
- Validate for cheating (speed, bounds, abilities)

### Reconciliation System
- **Compare** server state with client prediction
- If mismatch: rollback to server state and replay buffered inputs
- **Smooth corrections** to hide small discrepancies

## Implementation Milestones

### Phase 1: Input Buffering (Week 1)
**Goal**: Capture and send inputs instead of positions

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `InputBuffer` class to store inputs with timestamps
- [ ] Modify client to send input commands instead of positions
- [ ] Add sequence numbers to all input messages
- [ ] Server receives and queues input commands
- [ ] Basic server-side movement processing from inputs

**Success Criteria**: Player moves via server processing inputs (will be laggy but functional)

### Phase 2: Client Prediction (Week 2)
**Goal**: Instant local movement feedback

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `MovementPredictor` class with same physics as server
- [ ] Client applies movement inputs immediately to local player
- [ ] Store predicted states with sequence numbers
- [ ] Keep server updates separate from predicted position
- [ ] Visual player position uses predicted state

**Success Criteria**: Local movement feels instant, server updates don't interfere

### Phase 3: Server Reconciliation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Handle prediction errors gracefully

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Server sends back last processed input sequence with position
- [ ] Client compares server position with predicted position at that sequence
- [ ] Implement rollback: rewind to server state if mismatch detected
- [ ] Replay all inputs after the server's last processed input
- [ ] Add smoothing for small corrections

**Success Criteria**: Client corrects prediction errors without noticeable snapping

### Phase 4: Lag Compensation (Week 4)
**Goal**: Handle network latency properly

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Measure and track round-trip time per client
- [ ] Server processes inputs with timestamp compensation
- [ ] Client adjusts prediction timing based on latency
- [ ] Add jitter buffer for unstable connections
- [ ] Implement rollback for server-side hit detection

**Success Criteria**: Consistent feel regardless of ping (up to ~150ms)

### Phase 5: Anti-cheat Integration (Week 5)
**Goal**: Prevent cheating while maintaining smooth movement

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Server validates input timing and frequency
- [ ] Detect impossible movements (speed hacking, teleportation)
- [ ] Implement "trust but verify" approach
- [ ] Add player behavioral analysis
- [ ] Graceful handling of cheat detection

**Success Criteria**: Smooth gameplay with effective cheat prevention

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Classes Needed

```javascript
// Client-side
class InputBuffer {
  // Store inputs with sequence numbers and timestamps
  // Provide cleanup and retrieval methods
}

class MovementPredictor {
  // Mirror server movement physics exactly
  // Apply inputs and predict positions
}

class Reconciler {
  // Compare server vs predicted states
  // Handle rollback and replay
}

// Server-side
class InputProcessor {
  // Process inputs in order with lag compensation
  // Validate for cheating
}

class AuthorityManager {
  // Manage client trust levels
  // Handle anti-cheat responses
}
```

### Network Protocol Changes

```javascript
// Client → Server
{
  type: 'input',
  sequence: 1234,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  keys: ['w', 'a'],
  facing: 'nw'
}

// Server → Client
{
  type: 'authoritative_state',
  sequence: 1232, // Last processed input
  position: { x: 100, y: 200 },
  timestamp: serverTime
}
```

### Prediction Algorithm

```javascript
// Client prediction loop
function predictMovement(input) {
  // Apply input immediately
  const newState = applyPhysics(currentState, input);
  
  // Store for reconciliation
  stateHistory.push({
    sequence: input.sequence,
    state: newState
  });
  
  // Update visual immediately
  updatePlayerVisuals(newState);
}

// Reconciliation
function reconcile(serverState) {
  const predictedState = stateHistory[serverState.sequence];
  
  if (positionDiffers(serverState, predictedState)) {
    // Rollback and replay
    currentState = serverState;
    replayInputsAfter(serverState.sequence);
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Complexity**: This is a significant architectural change
- **Physics Sync**: Client and server physics must match exactly
- **Edge Cases**: Network issues, packet loss, rapid input changes

### Medium Risk
- **Performance**: More CPU usage for prediction and reconciliation
- **Memory**: Storing input/state history
- **Debugging**: Much harder to debug desync issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental rollout**: Test each phase thoroughly
- **Fallback mode**: Keep current system as backup
- **Extensive logging**: Track prediction accuracy and corrections
- **Performance monitoring**: Watch for CPU/memory impact

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Prediction accuracy**: >95% of predictions match server
- **Correction frequency**: <1 correction per 10 seconds
- **Input latency**: <16ms from input to visual response
- **Bandwidth impact**: <20% increase over current system

### User Experience Metrics
- **Perceived smoothness**: Eliminate visible jerkiness
- **Input responsiveness**: Instant visual feedback
- **Network tolerance**: Playable up to 150ms ping
- **Cheat prevention**: Maintain current anti-cheat effectiveness

## Timeline: 5-6 Weeks Total

**Week 1**: Input system foundation  
**Week 2**: Client prediction working  
**Week 3**: Basic reconciliation  
**Week 4**: Lag compensation  
**Week 5**: Anti-cheat integration  
**Week 6**: Polish and optimization  

This plan will deliver **professional-quality** movement that feels responsive while maintaining server authority for anti-cheat. It's a significant undertaking but will transform the game's feel from "playable but jerky" to "smooth and responsive."
