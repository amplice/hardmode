# Archived Documentation

These files have been archived because they contain outdated or aspirational information that doesn't match the current implementation.

## Why Archived

- **EXACT_GAMEPLAY_SPECIFICATION.md** - Contains accurate stats but implies more complex systems than implemented
- **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Describes future plans that may not align with current direction  
- **FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md** - Comprehensive but now superseded by unified CLAUDE.md
- **Client Prediction & Server Reconciliation.md** - Describes advanced networking not yet implemented

## Current Documentation

See the main **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** for accurate, up-to-date documentation that reflects the actual working implementation.

These archived files are kept for reference and may contain useful technical details, but should not be considered authoritative for current development.
