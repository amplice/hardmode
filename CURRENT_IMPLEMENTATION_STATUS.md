# Current Implementation Status

This document reflects the ACTUAL state of the multiplayer implementation as of the current branch.

## What's Working

### Core Multiplayer Features ✅
- **Player Synchronization**: Multiple players can see each other move in real-time
- **Class Selection**: Players choose their class before joining
- **Combat Synchronization**: Attacks are visible to all players
- **Monster AI**: Server-controlled monsters that chase and attack players
- **Death & Respawn**: 3-second respawn timer at spawn point
- **PvP**: Players can damage each other
- **Authoritative Server**: Server maintains game state at 30Hz

### Technical Implementation ✅
- Simple Socket.io event-based networking
- Client sends position updates every frame
- Server broadcasts full state 30 times per second
- No prediction, interpolation, or reconciliation needed
- Works well for small-scale multiplayer

## What's NOT Implemented

### From the Technical Documentation ❌
- TypeScript (using JavaScript)
- Entity Component System on server
- Client-side prediction
- Server reconciliation  
- Input buffering
- Network optimization (delta compression, etc.)
- Anti-cheat validation
- Spatial hashing
- Area of Interest management

### Why It Works Anyway
The current implementation is simple but effective:
1. **Direct position updates** - Client tells server where it is
2. **Frequent state broadcasts** - Server sends everything to everyone 30x/second
3. **Trust-based** - Server trusts client positions (no validation)
4. **Small scale** - Works fine for ~10 players

## The Gap
There's a significant gap between the documentation (ambitious TypeScript ECS architecture) and the implementation (simple JavaScript Socket.io game). However, the current implementation WORKS and player movement syncs properly.

## Recommendation
If player movement is syncing well on this branch, consider:
1. **Keep the simple approach** - It's working!
2. **Enhance incrementally** - Add features without breaking what works
3. **Ignore complex documentation** - It describes an ideal, not reality
4. **Focus on gameplay** - The simple netcode is sufficient
