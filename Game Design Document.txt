Game Concept
A skill-based, permadeath 2D MMORPG with minimalist combat mechanics. Players explore a procedurally generated world, fighting both monsters and other players. Combat is lethal and skill-based, with 1-2 hit kills being the norm, inspired by games like Nidhogg, Realm of the Mad God, and Bushido Blade. The game emphasizes player skill over grinding, with a low level cap and high-risk encounters.
Core Gameplay Loop

Create character and select class
Explore procedurally generated world
Fight monsters to gain limited progression (up to level 10)
Find/craft better equipment
Encounter and duel other players
Upon death, restart with a new character
Some progression elements persist between deaths

Combat System

Isometric viewpoint (Diablo 2 style)
WASD movement controls
Mouse used for aiming/directing attacks
Each class has only 2 distinct attacks (primary and secondary)
No traditional health bars - characters can only take 1-3 hits based on equipment
Combat based on timing, positioning, and hitbox interaction
Attacks have distinct animations with clear telegraphing
Armor provides additional hit protection at the cost of movement speed
Weapons determine attack range, speed, and hitbox patterns

Character Classes

Bladedancer - Fast, agile fighter with medium-range slashing attacks

Primary: Quick horizontal slash (wide but short range)
Secondary: Precise thrust (narrow but longer range)


Guardian - Slower, armored fighter with heavy attacks

Primary: Sweeping axe attack (wide arc, good coverage)
Secondary: Shield bash (short range, brief stun effect)


Hunter - Precision fighter with ranged capabilities

Primary: Bow shot (very long range, narrow hitbox)
Secondary: Quick dagger slash (very short range, fast execution)


Rogue - Extremely fast, high damage, but fragile

Primary: Quick dual dagger strike (very short range, high speed)
Secondary: Dash attack (short burst of movement with damage)



Progression System

Level cap at 10
Each level provides minor advantages:

+5% movement speed per level
+1 hit point at levels 3, 6, and 9


Equipment choices affect gameplay more than levels:

Light armor: 1 hit point, 100% speed
Medium armor: 2 hit points, 85% speed
Heavy armor: 3 hit points, 70% speed


A skilled level 1 player can defeat an unskilled level 10 player
Experience gained from defeating monsters and players

Permadeath Mechanics

Character death is permanent
Account-level progression persists:

Unlockable character appearances
Achievement tracking
Legacy board (record of past character accomplishments)


No direct power inheritance between characters
Optional "soul gem" rare item that allows one extra hit before death (consumed on use)

World Design

Open, procedurally generated world that refreshes weekly
Five distinct biomes:

Grasslands (starting area, easier monsters)
Ancient Forest (medium difficulty, dense vegetation)
Swamplands (difficult terrain, poisonous creatures)
Mountain Peaks (high-level monsters, sparse resources)
Corrupted Lands (endgame area, most dangerous)


Resource nodes for crafting materials
Monster dens with higher spawn rates
Safe settlements where PvP is disabled
Mysterious portals leading to instanced challenge areas

Social Systems

Temporary alliances (no formal guild/clan system)
Simple chat system (proximity-based and global channels)
Trading possible only in safe settlements
Leaderboards tracking:

Longest survival time
Most player kills
Highest monster kill count
Deepest exploration into dangerous zones



Crafting System

Minimalist approach focusing on equipment modification
Resources gathered throughout the world
Craftable consumables (temporary buffs, not direct healing)
Weapon enchantments altering attack patterns
Armor modifications (tradeoffs between protection and mobility)

Special Mechanics

Day/night cycle affecting monster types and behavior
Weather effects impacting visibility and movement
Environmental hazards (lava pools, quicksand, etc.)
Rare world events drawing players together (boss spawns, treasure hunts)
"Bounty" system placing temporary targets on highly successful players

Audio-Visual Style

Pixel art aesthetic with fluid animations
Distinctive silhouettes for each character class
Minimal UI elements preserving screen space
Dynamic lighting effects for time of day and spells
Responsive audio feedback for successful hits and near misses
Ambient environmental sounds based on biome
