Technical Architecture Document
Technology Stack

Frontend/Game Engine: PixiJS
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB + Redis
Networking: Socket.io

Components
Game Client

Rendering Engine: PixiJS for 2D rendering
Game Logic: Custom game framework built on top of PixiJS
Input System: Keyboard (WASD) and mouse controls
Animation System: Sprite-based animations with frame sequencing
Asset Management: Preloading and caching of game assets
Audio System: Web Audio API for sound effects and music
UI Layer: In-game HUD, menus, and dialogs
Network Layer: Socket.io client for real-time communication

Game Server

Core Server: Node.js with Express
Game Loop: Fixed timestep update cycle
World Management: Procedural generation and persistence
Entity System: Players, monsters, projectiles, items
Physics System: Simplified collision detection and resolution
AI System: Basic monster behaviors and pathing
Network Layer: Socket.io for client-server communication
Authentication: JWT-based player authentication

Database Layer

MongoDB: For persistent data storage

Player accounts
Character data
World state persistence
Leaderboards/statistics


Redis: For real-time game state

Player positions
Active game sessions
Temporary world state
Pub/sub for game events



Networking Model

Client-Server Architecture: All authoritative game logic runs on the server
State Synchronization: Server sends world updates to clients
Input Processing: Client sends inputs, server validates and processes
Area of Interest Management: Players only receive updates for nearby entities
Delta Compression: Only send changes in state to reduce bandwidth
Latency Compensation: Client-side prediction with server reconciliation

Scalability Approach

Initial Target: 100 concurrent players on a single server instance
Scaling Strategy:

Horizontal scaling with multiple game server instances
Socket.io with Redis adapter for cross-server communication
Sharding by geographic region within the game world
Load balancing incoming connections


Database Scaling:

MongoDB replica sets for data redundancy
Redis clustering for distributed in-memory data
