# README: Current State of Hardmode

## Quick Summary
This branch contains a **working multiplayer implementation** where player movement syncs properly between clients. The implementation is much simpler than what the documentation describes, but it works.

## How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000 in multiple browser windows
```

## What You'll See
- Class selection screen on startup
- Multiple players moving around in real-time
- Monsters chasing players
- Combat with visual feedback
- Death and respawn mechanics

## Architecture Reality Check

### What the Docs Say
- Complex TypeScript ECS architecture
- Client prediction and server reconciliation
- Sophisticated networking with delta compression
- Anti-cheat systems

### What Actually Exists  
- Simple JavaScript server (server.js)
- Basic Socket.io networking
- Client sends position, server broadcasts to all
- No validation, no prediction, just simple sync

### Why This Matters
The simple implementation **actually works**. Players can see each other move without lag or desync issues. The complex architecture in the docs was never fully implemented.

## Key Insights
1. **Simple can be better** - The basic Socket.io approach works fine for this game scale
2. **Documentation â‰  Reality** - The docs describe an ideal architecture, not what's built
3. **Trust-based networking** - Server trusts client positions, which is fine for a learning project
4. **30Hz is enough** - Server tick rate provides smooth gameplay

## For New Contributors
- Focus on the actual code, not the extensive documentation
- The multiplayer system is in `server.js` and `src/js/net/NetworkClient.js`
- Player movement already syncs well - don't break it!
- Add features incrementally without rewriting core systems

## Known Limitations
- No cheat prevention (client can send any position)
- Scales to ~10-20 players before performance issues
- No lag compensation or prediction
- Server doesn't validate physics

These limitations are acceptable for a hobbyist project focused on learning and fun gameplay.
