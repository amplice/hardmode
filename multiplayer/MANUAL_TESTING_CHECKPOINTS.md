# HARDMODE MULTIPLAYER - MANUAL TESTING CHECKPOINTS

## Overview

This document outlines specific checkpoints where manual testing makes sense during development. Each checkpoint represents a stable, testable state where specific features can be verified.

**IMPORTANT**: Don't attempt to test before reaching a checkpoint - the game won't be in a runnable state and you'll just encounter errors.

## Testing Prerequisites

Before any manual testing, ensure you have:
- Node.js 20+ installed
- npm 10+ installed
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Two browser windows/tabs for multiplayer testing

## Checkpoint 1: Server Infrastructure ‚úÖ READY NOW

**What's Ready**: Basic server starts and accepts connections

**When**: After server foundation is complete (GameServer, GameLoop, basic networking)

**How to Test**:
```bash
cd multiplayer
npm install # If not done yet
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**What to Verify**:

- [ ] Shows "Server running at http://0.0.0.0:3000"
- [ ] Health check works: Visit http://localhost:3000/health

## Quick Test Commands

Add these to your terminal for quick testing:

```bash
# Start everything
alias hardmode-dev="cd /path/to/hardmode/multiplayer && npm run dev"

# Just server
alias hardmode-server="cd /path/to/hardmode/multiplayer/server && npm run dev"

# Just client  
alias hardmode-client="cd /path/to/hardmode/multiplayer/client && npm run dev"

# Kill all Node processes (emergency)
alias hardmode-kill="killall node"
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Make sure you ran `npm install` in both `/multiplayer` and `/multiplayer/server`
- Check Node.js version is 20+

### Client Won't Connect
- Make sure server is running first
- Check browser console for errors
- Disable ad blockers (they can block WebSocket)
- Try a different browser

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications
- Use Chrome/Edge for best performance
- Check if CPU is thermal throttling
- Reduce number of test players

## Debug Commands

When testing, you can use browser console commands:

```javascript
// Show FPS counter
Game.showStats = true;

// Show hitboxes
Game.debugHitboxes = true;

// Show network stats
Game.showNetworkStats = true;

// Teleport player (testing only)
Game.player.teleport(x, y);
```

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Test One System at a Time**: Don't try to test combat before movement works
2. **Test Locally First**: Get single-player working before multiplayer
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Max players, high latency, packet loss
4. **Test Different Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Test Different Machines**: Not all computers are gaming PCs

Remember: Each checkpoint builds on the previous ones. Don't skip ahead!
